          <p>
            Masashi Kishimoto (岸本 斉史, Kishimoto Masashi, born November 8, 1974 is a Japanese manga artist, well known
            for creating the manga series Naruto which was in serialisation from 1999 to 2014. Kishimoto's first
            successful manga pilot was Karakuri (カラクリ lit. "Mechanism"?), which he submitted to Shueisha in 1995. This
            earned him an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly "Hop Step Award" in 1996, granted to promising rookie
            manga artists. At this point he was assigned an editor, Kosuke Yahagi, and worked on a number of rejected
            drafts including a slice-of-life manga, Michikusa (道くさ lit. "Wandering Detour"?), and an action manga, Asian
            Punk (アジアンパンク Ajian Panku?). In 1997 he wrote a one-shot version of Naruto which was published
            in Akamaru Jump Summer and was well received, but proved difficult to rework into a continuing series.

          <h2>1. Solo Leveling </h2>
          <p>
            In a world where hunters, humans who possess magical abilities, must battle deadly monsters to protect the
            human race from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly
            endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon
            that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player
            and in turn, gives him the extremely rare ability to level up in strength, possibly beyond any known limits.
            Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover
            the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.

            Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather
            instills two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." Yuji's
            friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unsealed a rotten finger talisman which
            Yuji swallowed to protect Megumi Fushiguro and their friends, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen
            Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and by extension, Yuji)
            immediately. But upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to
            the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and
            train under Gojo until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be completely destroyed.

            Mori Jin is a high school student and Taekwondo specialist who enters "The God of High School," a fighting
            tournament that promises the winner anything they want. What began as a competition to seek out the best high
            school fighter soon reveals itself to be part of a much greater plot that goes beyond Mori's wildest
            imagination. What will he give to become a true god?

            Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He became his
            family's breadwinner after his father's death, making trips to the nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything
            changed when he came home one day to discover that his family was attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjiro
            and his sister Nezuko were the sole survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but
            still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, a demon
            slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyū and sent to his retired master Sakonji Urokodaki for training to also
            become a demon slayer, beginning his quest to help his sister turn into human again and avenge the death of
            his family.

          <h2>5. Omniscient Reader </h2>
          <p>
            A novel called Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (written by the anonymous author tls123) has been
            written and published over the course of a decade, and Kim Dokja is the sole reader who has followed it to its
            ending. When the real world is plunged into the premise of Ways of Survival, Kim Dokja's unique knowledge of
            the novel becomes vital to his survival. Kim Dokja allies with Yoo Joonghyuk, the protagonist of Ways of
            Survival, in order to change the novel's original plot and more quickly approach the end of the story. As Kim
            Dokja and his party members progress through the scenarios, they face increasingly difficult threats and
            life-or-death challenges, struggling to stay alive and work together as they aim to destroy the Star Stream
            that demands their suffering
